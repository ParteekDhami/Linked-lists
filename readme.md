What is the assignment about?  
Purpose was to familiarize ourselves with using linked lists and stacks.

Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.
 The purpose of q1 was to mimic a car rental company's system where we made 3 lists called available, rented, and in_repair with functionality of a car rental system.

## Resources 
Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?

For this assignment I used lecture slides to understand how to implement Stacks and Linked Lists which helped me understand how they function/work and how to code them. I also used lab material to understand how to run the program with gcc and in the school server.
